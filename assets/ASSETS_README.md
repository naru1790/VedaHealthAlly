## Lottie Animations

This folder contains placeholder Lottie animation files for the Workout Wizard POC. 

For production, replace these with proper exercise animations from:
- **LottieFiles**: https://lottiefiles.com/
- **Free animations**: Search for "exercise", "workout", "fitness"

## Sound Files

### alarm.mp3
You need to add an alarm sound file named `alarm.mp3` to the `assets/sounds/` directory.

**Free sources:**
- Pixabay: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/
- Freesound: https://freesound.org/
- Zedge: https://www.zedge.net/

**Recommended characteristics:**
- Short beep or chime (1-2 seconds)
- Clear and attention-grabbing
- Not too harsh

**Temporary workaround:**
The app will handle the error gracefully if the file is missing. The rest timer will still work, just without sound.

## Current Placeholder Files

The following placeholder Lottie files are included:
- `squat.json` - Blue rectangle (represents squat)
- `pushup.json` - Red rectangle (represents pushup)  
- `plank.json` - Green rectangle (represents plank)
- `default.json` - Gray circle (default for unmapped exercises)

These are minimal valid Lottie JSON files that will render simple shapes. They serve as placeholders so the app doesn't crash.
